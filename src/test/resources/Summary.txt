1. TestNG - Testing Framework (Refer TestNG documentation)

2. Creating project - (Java - Maven)

3. Manual Test Case

4. Annotations:
	@Test
	@BeforeClass
	@AfterClass
	@BeforeMethod
	@AfterMethod

5. Runner File (TestNG documentation)

	1. To run whole package
	2. To run class
	3. To run method (include and exclude)

6. Groupings:

       1. We have to mention group at test level [eg @Test(groups = "Smoke")]
       2. We have to include group tag in runner file [eg - Runner4]

7. Priority and Dependency:

    1. By default, priority is set to 0 for all tests and it will run alphabetically
    2. under (), we can set priority for all test

8. How To use Base test

8. Parameters (3.6 on TestNG documentation)
    1. Include Parameter tag in Runner File, with Name and Value
    2. Include Parameter Annotation in Test File, with Name

9. Parallel Execution

    1. Include Parallel tag in Runner File with thread count (3.11 on TestNG documentation)

10. Reporting -

        1. Execute test from pom.xml
        2. Report will be saved in the target folder

11. Assertions and Soft Assertions -

	1. Hard Assertions - Stops execution immediately upon failure
	2. Soft Assertions - Continues test execution on failure

12. Data Driven Testing
